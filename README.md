ofxJavascript
======
ofxJavascript is an addon for openframeworks that allows applications to embed and execute Javascript with Mozilla "Spidermonkey" engine (https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/SpiderMonkey).
It was originally developped back in August 2009 and has not really evolved since then, although it was used in recent projects of mine where scripting allowed rapid prototyping.
